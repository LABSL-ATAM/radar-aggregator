<description>&lt;p&gt;Move over, collecting stickers off your Coke to try to win Monopoly. Dutch McDonald&#8217;s customers can DJ using a combination of their phone and a placemat. McDonalds McTrax from This Page Amsterdam on Vimeo. How does it work? Think conductive ink &#8211; the basics of electronics and resistive circuits (and, of course, something you can do with paper, too). Add the smartphone, and you get some fairly decent features: Trigger loops Play effects Control tempo Record samples The project is the work of interactive studio This Page Amsterdam, in conjunction with the agency TBWA/Neboko. The latter are responsible for &#8220;disruptieve ...&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Before you zip to the comments to scream &#8220;not a hack,&#8221; watch a few minutes of this teardown video. This 48 minute detailed walkthrough of a one-off art piece shows every aspect of the project: every requirement, design decision, implementation challenge, and mistake. Some notable details:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PCBs that are 1 meter wide (all one piece!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;350,000 white LEDs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Carbon fiber enclosures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1-wire serial bus (like the WS2812 only not quite) with 12 bit resolution (TLC5973)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customized cable test jigs, PCB test jigs, and test modes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An exploration on ESD issues in production&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s not often that one sees teardowns of  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hackaday.com/2016/05/05/amazing-analysis-of-a-350000-led-airport-art-project/&quot; class=&quot;read_more&quot;&gt;&#8230;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=hackaday.com&#038;blog=4779443&#038;post=203743&#038;subd=hackadaycom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

<description>&lt;p&gt;It seems these days all the electronics projects are wireless in some form. Whether you choose WiFi, Bluetooth Classic, Bluetooth Low Energy, ZigBee, Z-Wave, Thread, NFC, RFID, Cell, IR, or even semaphore or carrier pigeon depends a lot on the constraints of your project. There are a lot of variables to consider, so here is a guide to help you navigate the choices and come to a conclusion about which to use in your project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can really quickly reduce options down to the appropriate tech with just a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;You can find flex PCBs in just about every single piece of consumer electronics. These traces of copper laminated in sheets of Kapton are everywhere, and designing these cables, let alone manufacturing them, is a dark art for the garage electronics wizard. Having these flat flex cables and PCBs manufactured still requires some Google-fu or a contact at a fab house, but at least now designing these cables is a solved problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Oli] needed a way to connect two PCBs together over a moving part. Usually this means some sort of connector or cable, but he&#8217;s developed an even better  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hackaday.com/2016/05/05/designing-flat-flexible-pcbs/&quot; class=&quot;read_more&quot;&gt;&#8230;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=hackaday.com&#038;blog=4779443&#038;post=203469&#038;subd=hackadaycom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Students of the Samara State Aerospace University are having trouble getting a signal from their satellite, SamSat-218D. They are now reaching out to the radio amateur community, inviting everybody with sufficiently sensitive &lt;del&gt;UHF&lt;/del&gt; VHF band (144 MHz) equipment to help by listening to SamSat-218D. The satellite was entirely built by students and went into space on board of a Soyuz-2 rocket on April 26, 2016. This is their call (translated by Google):&lt;/p&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;Back in the day where the microprocessor was our standard building block, we tended to concentrate on computation and processing of data and not so much on I/O. Simply put there were a lot of things we had to get working just so we could then read the state of an I/O port or a counter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nowadays the microcontroller has taken care of most of the system level needs with the luxury of built in RAM memory and the ability to upload our code. That leaves us able to concentrate on the major role of a microcontroller: to interpret something  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hackaday.com/2016/05/05/analog-to-digital-conversion/&quot; class=&quot;read_more&quot;&gt;&#8230;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=hackaday.com&#038;blog=4779443&#038;post=203217&#038;subd=hackadaycom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

<description>&lt;p&gt;The incredible screw drive tractor is back. We&#8217;ve covered the previous test ride, which ended with a bearing pillow block ripping in half, but since then, again, a lot of repair work has been done. [REDNIC79] reinforced the load-bearing parts a&lt;span style=&quot;line-height:1.5;&quot;&gt;nd put on a fresh pair of &#8220;tires&#8221;. The result is still as unbelievable as the previous versions, but it now propels itself forward at a blazing 3 mph (this time without tearing itself apart).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[REDNIC79] walks us through all the details of the improvements he made since the first version. After the last failure, he figured, that a  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hackaday.com/2016/05/05/screw-drive-tractor-is-about-to-conquer-canada/&quot; class=&quot;read_more&quot;&gt;&#8230;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=hackaday.com&#038;blog=4779443&#038;post=203035&#038;subd=hackadaycom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Did you know the muzzle velocity of a NERF dart out of a toy gun? Neither did [MJHanagan] until he did all sorts of measurement. And now we all know: between 35 and 40 miles per hour (around 60 km/h).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, he prototyped a single beam-break detector (shown above) and then expanded his build to two in order to get velocity info. A Propeller microcontroller took care of measuring the timing. Then came the gratuitous statistics. He took six different darts and shot them each 21 times, recording the timings. Dart #3 was the winner, but they all had similar  &lt;a href=&quot;http://hackaday.com/2016/05/05/35-mph-nerf-darts/&quot; class=&quot;read_more&quot;&gt;&#8230;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=hackaday.com&#038;blog=4779443&#038;post=202191&#038;subd=hackadaycom&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</description>

I found it in his anthology, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0486281523/boingboing&quot;&gt;My Best Mathematical and Logic Puzzles&lt;/a&gt;, which is only $3.42 on Amazon.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a simple procedure by which two people can divide a cake so that each is satisfied he has at least half: One cuts and the other chooses. Devise a general procedure so that &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; persons can cut a cake into n portions in such a way that everyone is satisfied he has at least 1/&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; of the cake.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Religion blogger Fred Clark is fascinated with the urban legends and panic surrounding &quot;satanism,&quot; so years ago he set up a Google News Alert for the word &quot;Satanic.&quot; Over at Pathos, he posted the funny, ridiculous, and fascinating things he&apos;s learned. Here&apos;s a sample:
&lt;P&gt;



&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;P&gt;• Every year, dozens of filmmakers try to recapture the magic that made The Exorcist so unsettling. Most fail.&lt;P&gt;
• Pat Boone is still alive.&lt;P&gt;
• The political performance art of the Satanic Temple is both hilarious and pointedly effective. They’re defending the First Amendment the way that we Baptists are supposed to.&lt;P&gt;
• Adolescent legend tripping is happening all the time, every day, somewhere in the English-speaking world.&lt;P&gt;
• Adults who should know better are freaking out and over-reacting to adolescent legend tripping all the time, every day, somewhere in the English-speaking world.&lt;P&gt;
• Censorious adults worried about Kids Today listening to satanic heavy metal aren’t really keeping up with the satanic heavy metal acts trying hardest to gain their condemnation.&lt;P&gt;
• Same goes for video games.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<description>&lt;iframe class=&apos;youtube-player&apos; type=&apos;text/html&apos; width=&apos;600&apos; height=&apos;368&apos; src=&apos;http://www.youtube.com/embed/LnEyjwdoj7g?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;start=24&#038;wmode=transparent&apos; allowfullscreen=&apos;true&apos; style=&apos;border:0;&apos;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a good short lesson in public key cryptography. We also learn why a particular prime number that starts with 85650789657397829 and has 1402 more digits is an illegal number. If you have a DVD player, you are in possession of the number.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_prime&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;One of the earliest illegal prime numbers was generated in March 2001 by Phil Carmody. Its binary representation corresponds to a compressed version of the C source code of a computer program implementing the DeCSS decryption algorithm, which can be used by a computer to circumvent a DVD&apos;s copy protection.&quot;</description>

An officer went to the school office where the girl was being held, scaring the hell out of her and calling her grandmother with dire warnings about federal counterfeiting crimes being committed. 

&lt;p&gt;Bill in hand, the officer went to the store that gave the $2 bill to the girl&apos;s grandmother and questioned them, then went to a bank with the bill, where he was told that $2 bills are legal tender. The officer never apologized to the girl, who missed her lunch that day.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s right: the 13-year-old didn&apos;t even receive an apology from the authority figures, even though she was ultimately denied lunch that day, according to her grandmother. Grandma also had this to say: &quot;It was very outrageous for them to do it. There was no need for police involvement. They&apos;re charging kids like they&apos;re adults now.&quot; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;803&quot; height=&quot;515&quot; src=&quot;http://media.boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/viewphoto-1.aspx_.jpg&quot; class=&quot;attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; alt=&quot;viewphoto-1.aspx&quot; srcset=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/media.boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/viewphoto-1.aspx_.jpg?w=803 803w, http://i1.wp.com/media.boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/viewphoto-1.aspx_.jpg?resize=300%2C192 300w, http://i1.wp.com/media.boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/viewphoto-1.aspx_.jpg?resize=600%2C385 600w, http://i1.wp.com/media.boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/viewphoto-1.aspx_.jpg?resize=768%2C493 768w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 803px) 100vw, 803px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;
Researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign used ultrasound to transmit high-speed data through pork loin and beef liver. Why? They&apos;re developing a system for controlling wireless medical implants and also stream high-definition video from inside the body. 


&lt;P&gt;
&quot;You can imagine a device that is swallowed for the purposes of imaging the digestive tract but with the capability for the HD video to be continuously streamed live to an external screen and the orientation of the device controlled wirelessly and externally by the physician,&quot; says engineering professor Andrew Singer.
&lt;P&gt;
Singer and his colleagues posted their results on arXiv in a paper titled &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://engineering.illinois.edu/news/article/16408&quot;&gt;Mbps Experimental Acoustic Through-Tissue Communications: MEAT-COMMS&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;
&lt;P&gt;
“To our knowledge, this is the first time anyone has ever sent such high data rates through animal tissue,” Singer said. “These data rates are sufficient to allow real-time streaming of high definition video, enough to watch Netflix, for example, and to operate and control small devices within the body.”
&lt;P&gt;
That&apos;s a whole new spin on dinner and a movie.&lt;P&gt;

<pubDate>Thu, 05 May 2016 16:49:27 +0000</pubDate>
<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; src=&quot;http://media.boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/bks.jpg&quot; class=&quot;attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; alt=&quot;bks&quot; srcset=&quot;http://i2.wp.com/media.boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/bks.jpg?w=600 600w, http://i2.wp.com/media.boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/bks.jpg?resize=300%2C188 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a true crime journalist who searches for the missing, I am keenly aware of the breadcrumbs I’m leaving behind throughout a typical day. If I were to suddenly disappear, these bits of information will mean everything to detectives. But I worry that these clues will be misleading, that my receipts and cell phone pings will only muddy the waters of the official investigation should I vanish without a trace, because the littlest detail can seem quite suspicious when taken out of context.

&lt;div style=&quot;width:228px;float:right;margin:0px 0px 1em 2em&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/tca.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;tca&quot; width=&quot;228&quot; height=&quot;342&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-460497&quot; /&gt;
James Renner is a novelist and journalist from Ohio. He’s new work of nonfiction, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1250089018/boingboing&quot;&gt;True Crime Addict&lt;/a&gt;, follows his investigation into the disappearance of Maura Murray. It’s available everywhere books are sold, May 24.
&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;For instance, the police might find the credit card slip in my car that shows I was in the bad part of Akron, today, and think that has something to do with whatever happened. That’s where people go to buy crack, after all. But really, I only drove out to Exchange because I found a new place over there that serves authentic Pho. Yesterday, I paid for several mirrors at a craft-supply store I’d never visited in the past. If I disappeared, the detectives will wonder why I altered my routine that day. Maybe they’ll suspect I was using those mirrors to cut cocaine (my son needed them to build a periscope for Cub Scouts – honest!).
	&lt;p&gt;When someone goes missing, the clues they leave behind lack context. There’s no telling which detail is important and which isn’t. And the cases that go cold often contain more clues than the ones that don’t. It makes a certain kind of sense, if you think about it. These unsolved cases lack focus because there’s just enough evidence to lead a detective in any direction they wish to go. Without focus, how can an investigator hone in on the solution?
	&lt;p&gt;A disappearance is a half-finished story. Is the victim alive? Are they dead? Other crimes at least have a conclusion: murder, robbery, assault. We know what we’re dealing with. Not so with disappearances.
	&lt;p&gt;Of course, that’s what I like about them. And I suspect I’m not alone. After all, who doesn’t like a challenge?
	&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I’ve kept a log of the most alluring disappearances. I present them here, in no particular order.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-05-at-9.23.12-AM.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2016-05-05 at 9.23.12 AM&quot; width=&quot;618&quot; height=&quot;266&quot; class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-460503&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;10. Ted Conrad&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case Background: It was the summer of 1969 and the future looked bright for young Ted Conrad. He was a handsome, bright kid with a nice job at Society National Bank, in Cleveland. He had a cute girlfriend and an apartment in Lakewood. He could have done anything he set his mind to. And what he set his mind to that summer was robbing the his bank.
	&lt;p&gt;Conrad was a fan of &lt;em&gt;The Thomas Crown Affair&lt;/em&gt;, the one with Steve McQueen. He watched the movie over and over, religiously and began to model himself after McQueen’s debonair character, purchasing a sports car and becoming fluent in French. On his twentieth birthday – Friday, July 11 – Conrad purchased a fifth of whiskey and smokes during his lunch break and made sure to show everyone the bag as he returned to the vault for the remainder of the day. When his shift was over, he walked out of the bank with the paper bag. But this time it was filled with $215,000. That was a lot of cheese in 1969 – adjusted for inflation, that’s equal to about $1.3 million, today.
	&lt;p&gt;Nobody noticed he was missing until Monday. By the time the bank figured out it had been robbed, Conrad had a four day head start on the F.B.I.

&lt;p&gt;Possible Solutions: Conrad would be sixty-six years old, today. Family members claim he never contacted them after he fled Cleveland and his brother-in-law believes he’s dead. Conrad was spotted at a bar in Hawaii a couple weeks after the theft, by a couple from Cleveland on vacation. Before he vanished for good, Conrad sent his girlfriend a letter postmarked from Engelwood, California, near Los Angeles International Airport.
	&lt;p&gt;Want to hear something really crazy? I was watching an episode of Anthony Bourdain’s &lt;em&gt;No Reservations&lt;/em&gt; not long after I reported on Conrad’s disappearance for &lt;em&gt;The Free Times&lt;/em&gt;. It was the episode where Bourdain travels to Hawaii and meets a strange old man living in a house on a volcano. The old man wouldn’t talk about his past and refused to leave the evacuation area as the lava fields drew near. I’m not positive, but damn it if that strange man doesn’t look like an old Teddy Conrad.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/mm.jpg&quot; class=&quot;alignleft&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;9. Madeleine McCann&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case Background: The disappearance of Madeleine McCann is easily the most publicized missing persons case this century. But for all the reports and news specials, the mystery remains unsolved. Madeleine was from Leicester, a city near the center of England. She was on vacation with her family at Praia da Luz, a Portugal resort, in May, 2007, a week before her fourth birthday, when she vanished from the ground-floor bedroom of a rented apartment near the beach. Her parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, had gone with friends to eat dinner at a restaurant a mere 160 feet from the apartment door. During the meal, members of their group went to check on Madeleine, who was sleeping in a bedroom with her younger siblings. The McCanns had left the patio door unlocked so they could easily come in and out to check on them. Madeleine’s mother discovered her daughter was missing sometime around 10 p.m. The bedroom window was open, the girl was gone.

&lt;p&gt;Possible Solutions: How can a girl just disappear from a popular holiday resort? Was she abducted? Was her death accidental and her body hidden? Is she still alive? Early scrutiny fell on Madeleine’s parents but it’s very difficult to believe they could have had anything to do with some kind of rushed cover-up while dining with seven friends. And it was Madeleine’s father who reported the girl missing at 10:10 p.m. that night. In the last nine years, according to the BBC, police have taken 1,338 statements and have looked closely at 60 persons of interest. There have been over 8,000 reported sightings of Madeleine from all over the world – so many, in fact, that the sightings, alone, have their own Wikipedia page. In a recent interview, Kate McCann said she believes her daughter is still alive, and being held not far from Praia da Luz.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/db.jpg&quot; class=&quot;alignleft&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;8. D.B. Cooper&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case Background: This case is fascinating because it is actually a series of mysteries. On November 24, 1971, a handsome, well-dressed, Don Draper-type who called himself “Dan Cooper,” boarded a Boeing 727 at Portland International Airport for a thirty-minute hop to Seattle. He lit a cigarette, ordered a bourbon and soda, and when the plane took off, he handed a stewardess a note in which he claimed to have a bomb. He then casually asked for $200,000 cash and four parachutes to be delivered in exchange for the passengers when they reached Seattle. The FBI met his demands and the passengers and some crew were released before Cooper instructed the pilot to take off again. After they were in the air, he told the rest of the crew to join the captain in the cockpit and stay there with the door closed. At about 8 p.m., the aft airstairs opened up and Cooper jumped out with the money and two parachutes. It remains the only unsolved hijacking in American history.
	&lt;p&gt;So who was “Dan Cooper?” And where did he go?

&lt;p&gt;Possible Solutions: There are dozens of men who have been suspected of being D.B. Cooper, as he came to be known thanks to a newspaper misprint. Several books have been written, pointing fingers at different suspects. But to date, none of these men have been linked to the fingerprints and DNA the FBI have on file. It’s possible the hijacker died as soon as he jumped from the plane, his neck snapping when the parachute opened, his corpse slowly falling into the deep woods south of Seattle. Perhaps he landed in a river or lake and that’s why no body was ever found. After all, an eight-year-old boy discovered a couple bundles of Cooper’s ransom cash in the Columbia River, in 1980. But if Cooper did die that day, there has to be a missing persons report that matches him out there somewhere, since he never managed to return to the life he left behind.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/alb.jpg&quot; class=&quot;alignleft&quot; /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;7. Amy Lynn Bradley&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case Background: In March of 1998, twenty-three-year-old Amy Lynn Bradley joined her parents and brother on a Caribbean cruise, while on break from college. They were aboard Royal Caribbean Cruise Line’s &lt;em&gt;Rhapsody of the Seas&lt;/em&gt;, en route to Curacao, the morning of March 24 when she suddenly vanished. She was seen around 5:30 a.m., on the balcony of her family’s suite. Her father realized she was missing around 6 a.m. The balcony door was left open and her sandals were just inside the room. This occurred just as the ship was entering the Curacao port and her father asked the crew to not let anyone off until they found Amy but the gangplank was lowered anyway.
	&lt;p&gt;The night before her disappearance, Amy and her brother were up until 3:30 a.m., partying at the disco with the ship’s band, Blue Orchid. Amy was last seen in an elevator with one of the band members, a man known as “Yellow,” according to The Charley Project website.

&lt;p&gt;Possible Solutions: Though she was last seen on a cruise ship, it’s not likely that Amy could have jumped from the balcony or have been pushed into the ocean. At the time of her disappearance, the ship was pulling into Curacao and she likely would have been seen by crew or tourists on land if she’d fallen into the water. She was also an excellent swimmer. So, did Amy exit with the other passengers on Curacao? Did she decide to stay on her own or was she kidnapped? Two Canadian tourists claimed they saw Amy on a beach in Curacao in 1998, and even identified her tattoos. And, in 1999, a man in the Navy came forward saying he saw Amy in a Caribbean brothel, leading to speculation that she may have been sold into sex slavery.

The 229 People Aboard MH370&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case Background: In this day of constant surveillance, advanced radar technology, and heightened airline security it is inconceivable that a large passenger jet could simply vanish without a trace. And yet that’s exactly what happened on March 8, 2014, when Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 flew out of Kuala Lumpur International Airport and failed to arrive as scheduled in Beijing. Everything seemed fine when the captain communicated with air traffic control in Kuala Lumpur, but then he failed to check in with their Ho Chi Minh City counterparts when the plane crossed into Vietnamese airspace. At the same time, the jet’s transponder stopped functioning and it could no longer be tracked by tradition radar. However, military radar still had it. They tracked Flight 370 as it went off course and turned to the southwest. The aircraft’s satellite data unit continued to communicate with its satellite, even though the transponder was down. The SDU data suggests Flight 370 flew west for another five hours before it stopped transmitting altogether.

&lt;p&gt;Possible Solutions: Oh man, how far down the rabbit hole do you want to jump? There are those who believe the flight was hijacked by terrorists who diverted it to Afghanistan so the aircraft could be used in a future attack. Others believe that twenty-two employees of a semiconductor company who were passengers aboard Flight 370 had to be murdered to silence what they knew about stealth technology. And there are some who blame things like black holes, aliens, and Shakira (I’m not kidding).
	&lt;p&gt;If Flight 370 was hijacked perhaps it was taken over by the two men who used stolen passports to clear security in Kuala Lumpur. Or maybe the captain decided to commit suicide and take everyone with him – it’s happened before. Maybe the lithium-ion batteries in the cargo hold caught fire and fried the electrical system.
	&lt;p&gt;Last year, debris from a Boeing 777 washed up on a beach on Reunion Island, in the western Indian Ocean. Since then, other pieces of an aircraft have been found along the coast of Mozambique. Though these artifacts have yet to be conclusively linked to Flight 370, they do fit the pattern of debris we expected to find if it crashed into the Indian Ocean.
	&lt;p&gt;But if it is Flight 370 how did it get so off course? What happened on board that plane for six hours after it lost contact with air traffic controllers? 

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/tc.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;tc&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;166&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-460518&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. Tara Calico&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case Background: Nineteen-year-old Tara Calico borrowed her mother’s bicycle and went for a ride near her house in the small town of Belen, New Mexico, the morning of September 20, 1988. She was listening to her Walkman as she pedaled along her usual route down Highway 47. She was due to return home by noon and was last seen around 11:45 a.m., two miles away. Her mother went searching for her at 12:05 p.m. When she could not find her, she contacted police. Later, part of Tara’s Walkman was found near a campground, nineteen miles away. Neither Tara nor the bicycle were ever found.

&lt;p&gt;Possible Solutions: There are two clear possibilities in Tara’s case: 1. She was abducted by a man or a group of men. 2. Her death was accidental but covered up.
	&lt;p&gt;One clue that supports the abduction theory is the disturbing Polaroid photograph that was discovered in a parking lot in Port St. Joe, Florida, in 1989. It’s a picture of a woman who resembles Tara, bound and gagged in the back of a van beside a young boy, who is also restrained. Her mother believes it to be Tara and points to the scar seen on the woman’s leg that matches an injury Tara suffered in a car accident, as proof. But some police detectives who worked on the case lean toward a simpler explanation: that Tara was accidentally struck by a truck, driven by a boy she knew. That boy, and at least one friend, then covered it up, disposing of Tara’s body and the bike. Valencia County Sheriff Rene Rivera has publicly stated he believes this is what happened but cannot prosecute due to lack of a body.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/rg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;rg&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;190&quot; class=&quot;alignleft size-full wp-image-460520&quot; /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Ray Gricar&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case Background: On April, 15, 2005, the District Attorney for Centre County, Pennsylvania, vanished under very mysterious circumstances. He was playing hooky that Friday, as he liked to do, driving through Brush Valley, cruising the back roads of rural P.A. When he didn’t return that evening, his girlfriend reported him missing. Police found his red MINI Cooper parked in the lot of an antique store in Lewisburg, near a bridge over the Susquehanna River. He was never seen again. A few months later, fishermen recovered Gricar’s laptop computer from the river. The hard drive had been removed. The hard drive was eventually discovered on the shore but it was so damaged, nobody could recover the data it once contained. A search of his home computer found Internet searches for “how to wreck a hard drive” and “water damage to a notebook computer.”

&lt;p&gt;Possible Solutions: This one gets weird, fast. First, there’s the rumor that Gricar was murdered to avoid a sex scandal. You see, Gricar’s office had investigated Jerry Sandusky after kids came forward claiming they had been sexually abused by the Penn State assistant football coach. But in 1998, Gricar declined to press charges and the truth didn’t come out for another thirteen years. Some believe that Gricar, facing retirement in 2005, was finally going to make the allegations public and had met someone in the parking lot about this, only to be killed.
	&lt;p&gt;I prefer to believe that Gricar staged his disappearance and changed his identity to live out the remainder of his life, quietly. And I think he did it in such a way as to pay homage to a science fiction book he once consulted on. Author Pamela West approached Gricar about twenty years before he disappeared, asking for a little help with a novel she was working on, titled &lt;em&gt;20/20 Vision&lt;/em&gt;. It was a mystery loosely based on the cold case murder of Penn State student Betsy Aardsma, but it used time travel to solve the crime. In the novel, the main character disappears from State College, on April 14. Like Gricar, this detective was about to retire. And cigarette ash was found in Gricar’s vehicle, just like in the book, though neither Gricar, nor the protagonist smoked.

&lt;p&gt;Case Background: Brian Shaffer was dashingly handsome med student at Ohio State University when he disappeared after a night of drinking, on Friday, March 31, 2006. Shaffer and his friend, William “Clint” Florence, met up at the Ugly Tuna Saloona around 9 p.m. and then went bar-hopping for several hours before returning to the Ugly Tuna just before 2 a.m. The bar’s security camera shows Brian walking in but never coming out, again. His friends say they figured he’d gone home. He wasn’t reported missing until Monday, when he didn’t show up to catch a flight to Miami, where he planned to spend Spring Break with his girlfriend.

&lt;p&gt;Possible Solutions: Not long before he went missing, Brian Shaffer’s mother died and those close to him say he took it hard. This event, and the pressures of medical school, lead some to believe he committed suicide, though no body has ever been found. Perhaps instead of killing himself, he simply walked away from his life. Others suspect foul play. His friend, Clint Florence, refuses to take a lie detector test. But again, where is the body? How did Brian get out of the bar without being seen by security cameras? Two New York homicide detectives have even suggested Brian was the victim of the Smiley Face serial killer, a rumored boogeyman who draws smiley faces near the locations of the bodies he’s dumped in rivers.

Case Background: On Australia Day, in 1966, Jane, Arnna, and Grant Beaumont disappeared from Glenelg Beach near Adelaide, South Australia. Jane was the oldest at nine. Arnna was seven. Grant, just four. Their parents often let Jane take her younger siblings to the beach to play that summer. The children set out from home at 10 a.m. and were supposed to return at 2. When they still hadn’t come home by 7:30 that night, their parents called police. No trace of them has ever been found.
	&lt;p&gt;Several witnesses came forward later to say they’d seen the Beaumont children playing at the beach. The children were seen in the company of tall, blond man with a thin face and a sun tan. They also bought a meat pie from a local vendor, which was strange for two reasons: 1. They’d come into the store before, but never for a meat pie. 2. Nobody knows where the children got the money for the snack, as they were not sent out from home with enough coin to cover it. 

&lt;p&gt;Possible Solutions: Washed out to sea? Jane was the only one of the lot who could swim, and she couldn’t swim all that well. Did Grant wander into the ocean, prompting his older sisters to attempt a rescue? Were they killed in an accident while walking along Jetty Road, their bodies hidden as part of a cover-up? Did the tall, blond man abduct them? Was he the person who gave the children money for the meat pie? A reward of $1 million still stands for information that might solve this mystery.

&lt;p&gt;Case Background: On the surface, Maura Murray appeared to be the quintessential All-American Girl: track star, former West Point cadet, nursing student, and cute as a button. Then a series of strange events began one night while Maura was working the security desk at Melville Hall, on the campus of UMass, Amherst. This was Thursday, February 5, 2004. A shift manager found Maura at her desk in a catatonic state. All she would say was, “my sister.” The manager escorted her back to her room. The next day, school was canceled due to snow. That Saturday, Maura’s father, Fred, came to visit, with $4,000 in cash, to find her a new car, he says, though they never purchased one. On Saturday night Maura wrecked Fred’s car on the way back to his motel room around 3:30 a.m. On Monday morning, Maura sent an email to professors, stating that she would not be in class that week due to a death in the family – this was a lie. Nobody had died.
	&lt;p&gt;That afternoon, Maura got into her car, stopped by an ATM to empty out her bank account, and then drove north into the White Mountains of New Hampshire, where she got into another accident, this time smashing into a snow bank. A bus driver who lived nearby stopped to ask if she needed help. She declined. The time between the accident and the moment the first officer arrived on scene was between five and seven minutes. Sometime in that window, Maura vanished.

&lt;p&gt;Possible Solutions: I began investigating Maura’s disappearance in 2010 and what I found was quite shocking. Maura was not the angelic young woman presented in early media reports. At the time of her disappearance she was in trouble for credit card fraud and identity theft. She left West Point in the middle of a judicial inquiry that was launched when she stole makeup from the commissary at Fort Knox. And she had been having an affair with her track coach and sometimes told him that she wanted to run away and start a new life.
	&lt;p&gt;Where was Maura going when she crashed her car in New Hampshire? What happened to her afterwards? Was she heading into the White Mountains to commit suicide, to go off and die “like an old squaw,” as her father suggested to police. Was she picked up by a serial killer? Or did she use an underground railroad for abused women to aide her escape into Canada?</description>

In India, 11,000 people die each year in automobile accidents tied to potholes or speed bumps, presumably because drivers fly over them, often on purpose. India&apos;s minister of road transport, Nitin Gadkari, hopes faux speed bumps will help by encouraging drivers to slow down while reducing the risk when they don&apos;t. 

&quot;We are trying out 3D paintings used as virtual speed breakers to avoid unnecessary requirements of speed breakers,&quot; Gadkari &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nitin_gadkari/status/724834865942806528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; along with the image above.
&lt;P&gt;
The optical illusions have been tried in other countries, including the US, as I &lt;a href=&quot;http://boingboing.net/2008/06/30/fake-speed-bumps-pai.html&quot;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; back in 2008.
&lt;P&gt;
&quot;Initially they were great,&quot; Phoenix, Arizona police traffic coordinator officer Terry Sills said at the time. &quot;Until people found out what they were.&quot;

<title>Hex bit sockets make Allen keys irrelevant</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;http://media.boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/419qtkc-tmL.jpg&quot; class=&quot;attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image&quot; alt=&quot;419qtkc-tmL&quot; srcset=&quot;http://i1.wp.com/media.boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/419qtkc-tmL.jpg?w=400 400w, http://i1.wp.com/media.boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/419qtkc-tmL.jpg?resize=300%2C300 300w&quot; sizes=&quot;(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;
I hate Allen keys. This &lt;a href=&quot;http://amzn.to/1NkQ2p5&quot;&gt;set of ⅜&quot; drive hex bit sockets&lt;/a&gt; means I rarely have to fight one of those stupid tiny things again!
&lt;p&gt;
Ever tried getting an over tightened socket head screw out of a 40 year old motorcycle&apos;s drain pan with 2 ½&quot; long Allen key? I gave up. I ordered this set of ⅜&quot; drive sockets to make the job easy, and it was. They come in handy when building a Blahblahblah from Ikea, or pretty much anything that needs a hex bit wrench.  
&lt;p&gt;
This Crafstman set comes with sockets sized 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10. 3 and 4 seem typical for most build-it-yourself furnishing. 6, 7 and 8 seem to be useful all over German and English motorcycles. Getting the seat off a Triumph is now a lot easier.  
&lt;P&gt;
Not that a lot of socket fasteners come with dictated torque settings, but it is notionally helpful to be able to put these on the torque wrench as well.
&lt;p&gt;
I should likely get a set of Torx bits as well, although I still like &lt;a href=&quot;http://boingboing.net/2015/10/15/the-torx-wrench-set-for-me.html&quot;&gt;what I currently use&lt;/a&gt;.

The once famed &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Endeavour&quot;&gt;HMS Endeavor&lt;/a&gt;, Captain Cook&apos;s ship as he claimed Australia for the British, later renamed something boring and sunk as part of the Royal Navy&apos;s blockade of Newport, Rhode Island, has sort of been found! The British scuttled 13 ships to block the harbor, and research has shown a ship formerly known as Endeavor, was sank in a group of 5 recently identified wrecks. One of them is almost certainly Cook&apos;s ship.
&lt;p&gt;
Via &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.sky.com/story/1690207/captain-cooks-ship-hms-endeavour-found&quot;&gt;Sky News&lt;/a&gt;:


&lt;blockquote&gt;Lead investigator Dr Kathy Abbass told Sky News: &quot;We may have been looking right at her without even knowing it.
&lt;p&gt;
&quot;The important thing now is to get the funding so that we can build the facilities to process and house all of the artefacts we must examine to prove which one of the wrecks is Endeavour&quot;.
&lt;p&gt;
Rhode Island Historical Preservation and Heritage Commission Charlotte Taylor said: &quot;It really isn&apos;t easy to explore these sites.
&lt;P&gt;
A print from a painting showing Captain James Cook (1728 - 1779) taking possession of New South Wales
Captain Cook takes possession of New South Wales
&lt;P&gt;
&quot;It takes time, money and effort at each step.
&lt;p&gt;
&quot;Divers battle very poor visibility and lots of silt, which is hard to remove and risky to do, because it has essentially been protecting the wood of these ships for hundreds of years.&quot;
&lt;p&gt;
The group from the Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project hopes to have found and explored the fifth site by this summer.
&lt;p&gt;
The Endeavour is one of the most famous ships in naval history.
&lt;p&gt;
Captain James Cook sailed her to Australia and New Zealand in 1768.

My favorite airport in America is changing its name to &quot;Hollywood Burbank Airport,&quot; removing the name of racist, reactionary old-timey boob Bob Hope, whose name has been judged not to resonate with the modern traveller.

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.getty.edu&quot;&gt;The Getty Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, the philanthropic arm of the J. Paul Getty Trust, established a program to create opportunities for college under grads, from cultures typically under represented in the arts, to get paid while gaining experience at real, interesting jobs. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.getty.edu/foundation/initiatives/current/mui/mui_students.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Multicultural Undergraduate Internship program&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is so good that white woman Samantha Niemann is suing them for discrimination, as she feels she should be a recipient. 
&lt;p&gt;
Via &lt;a href=&quot;http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2016/05/02/woman-alleges-getty-foundation-internship-only-open-to-non-white-applicants/&quot;&gt;CBS LA&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;P&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Niemann — who is of German, Irish and Italian descent — was told by a Getty Foundation representative that she was disqualified from applying
because of her race and national origin, the suit states.
&lt;p&gt;
A student at Southern Utah University with a 3.7 grade-point average, the lawsuit argues Neimann was “well-qualified” for the internship.
&lt;p&gt;
According to the Getty Foundation’s website, the Multicultural Undergraduate Internship program is aimed at encouraging “greater diversity in the professions related to museums and the visual arts.”
&lt;p&gt;
The program supports “substantive, full-time summer work opportunities for college undergraduates from cultural backgrounds that have traditionally been underrepresented in the arts,” the website states.
&lt;p&gt;
Ron Hartwig, vice president of communications for the J. Paul Getty Trust, issued a statement in response to the lawsuit, which read in part: “Over the past 23 years Getty grants have supported over 3,000 internships at 152 organizations throughout the county. We review and revise all of our grant categories from time to time and over the years have made a number of policy and procedural changes to the internship program.”
&lt;p&gt;
Several months ago – due to inquiries from potential applicants as well as internal and external discussions – the Getty modified the eligibility criteria for 2016 to state that applicants must be members of an underrepresented group, including but not limited to, those of black, Asian, Latino, Native-American or Pacific-Islander descent, according to Hartwig.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Megg and Mogg in Amsterdam (and Other Stories)&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;br&gt;by Simon Hanselmann

&lt;br&gt;Fantagraphics

&lt;br&gt;2016, 164 pages, 6.6 x 9.1 x 0.8 inches 

&lt;br&gt;$14 &lt;a class=&quot;amazon-button&quot; href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/160699879X/thebooklab-20&quot;&gt;Buy a copy on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire loveably dysfunctional freak family that stole our hearts in &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://winkbooks.net/post/100666796264/an-occult-dressed-stoner-comic-with-ennui-wafting&quot;&gt;Megahex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; (and sold them on the black market for hookers and blow) are back in &lt;i&gt;Megg and Mogg in Amsterdam (and Other Stories)&lt;/i&gt;. Once again we enter the bizarre funhouse world of Megg the witch, her cat familiar/lover Mogg, and their coterie of hangers on: Owl, Werewolf Jones, Mike the Gnome, Booger (a boogey woman), Dracula, Jr., and others. 

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the surface, little has changed. The revolving door of Megg and Mogg’s house still spins to let their drug-addled crew enter, hatch a series of ridiculous schemes, inhale all of the drugs and fast food, and then we get to watch as one nightmarish scenario after another plays out like a slow-motion train wreck. But there are deeper relationship themes that run through &lt;em&gt;Megg and Mogg in Amsterdam&lt;/em&gt;. Over the course of the book, strips begin to introduce trouble in Megg and Mogg’s relationship, and Megg’s growing attraction to Booger. Werewolf Jones also is having trouble in his marriage and is fighting to retain custody of his two sons (while doing every boneheaded thing in the world to ensure that doesn’t happen). The title of the book refers to a trip that Megg and Mogg take to Amsterdam to try and patch up their failing relationship. 

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The level of depression and depravity that drives Megg and Mogg (even more intense here than in &lt;em&gt;Megahex&lt;/em&gt;) might be too much for some, but there is also an undeniable heart that beats at the center of this work. There is obviously a lot of love and solidarity to be found within the complex relationships between these characters – in the midst of the binge drugging, the frequent release of bodily fluids, and the seeming complete lack of any motivation or ambition on anyone’s part. The gloss of &lt;em&gt;Megg and Mogg&lt;/em&gt; is undeniably juvenile, but it all feels deftly counter-balanced by an intelligence and a weird shape of hope that always keeps me rooting for these cartoon human monstrosities. 

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Megg and Mogg’s world leaks into mine:&lt;/strong&gt; While I was reading the book and preparing for this review, I had to get up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom. There I was, at 4am, in my boxer shorts, on the crapper, reading &lt;em&gt;Megg and Mogg&lt;/em&gt;. All of a sudden, on the floor right below the book, a black cockroach the size of a midsized American car darted out from between my feet (I rarely get roaches in my house). I freaked. I leaped off the commode, threw the book on the edge of the tub, and grabbed the nearby toilet plunger. The next thing I know, I have the plunger in one hand, a can of Lysol in the other (to smoke him out), and I’m trying to wail away on him without spraying the book with Lysol. After having binge-read &lt;em&gt;Megg and Mogg&lt;/em&gt; for a couple of days, I had this very bizarre feeling, there in my underwear, in my admittedly filthy bathroom, that I had somehow entered the aesthetic world of the book. It was a truly bizarre feeling. After the roach had been dispatched, and the fog of disinfectant had settled, I at least knew that I’d found the perfect place to photograph the book for this review. You’re welcome, Internet.</description>

No spandex in the Power Rangers reboot coming to theaters next March. 
&lt;P&gt;
“It’s tricky finding a new language for a superhero costume,” production designer Andrew Menzies (&lt;em&gt;G.I. Joe: Retaliation&lt;/em&gt;) told &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ew.com/article/2016/05/05/power-rangers-reboot-new-suits-first-look&quot;&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/a&gt;. “Ours is an alien costume that grows on them, that’s not man-made. You can’t win everyone over, but we are trying to appeal to a more mature audience and gain new fans.”

After decades of fighting for open Web standards that let anyone implement software to receive and render online data, the World Wide Web Consortium changed course and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/blog/2016/04/html-media-extensions-to-continue-work/&quot;&gt;created EME&lt;/a&gt;, a DRM system that locks up video in formats that can only be played back with the sender&apos;s blessing, and which also gives media giants the power to threaten and sue security researchers who discover bugs in their code.

&lt;p&gt;The BBC reports that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-36213580&quot;&gt;he regards himself as the victim of false allegations&lt;/a&gt; after security researchers revealed his earlier &quot;proof&quot; was no such thing.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Craig Wright had pledged to move some of the virtual currency from one of its early address blocks, an act many believe can only be done by the tech&apos;s creator.&lt;p&gt;
This would have addressed complaints that earlier evidence he had published online was misleading.
Dr Wright said that he was &quot;sorry&quot;.&lt;p&gt;
&quot;I believed that I could put years of anonymity and hiding behind me,&quot; he blogged.&lt;p&gt;
&quot;But, as the events of this week unfolded and I prepared to publish the proof of access to the earliest keys, I broke. I do not have the courage. I cannot.&lt;p&gt;
&quot;When the rumours began, my qualifications and character were attacked. When those allegations were proven false, new allegations have already begun. I know now that I am not strong enough for this.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This doesn&apos;t prove that he isn&apos;t Satoshi. But the evidence being requested would be no big deal were he the real Satoshi, as he claims, and wanted to convince people of it, which he does. It&apos;s all very odd. At this point, he looks like Uri Geller smiling helplessly in front of Johnny Carson, explaining that he can&apos;t bend the spoons because something bad is in the air.

&lt;p&gt;But that&apos;s a bit easy, isn&apos;t it? People are going to be talking about hidden agendas as much as simply writing him off: is he deliberately obscuring things? Is he a stalking horse or scapegoat of some kind? 

&lt;p&gt;Technically-brilliant people aren&apos;t necessarily good at social manipulation (or avoiding being socially manipulated). The old sawhorse is 
to say &lt;em&gt;&quot;follow the money&quot;&lt;/em&gt;. Funny how that&apos;s not always an option, especially when the ledgers are immaculate.

&lt;p&gt;The tone of his blog post -- an enigmatic disappearance that leaves the suggestion of his identity unresolved -- is very alarming.</description>

Jeff writes, &quot;Combined, Washington State is providing Microsoft and Boeing $1 billion annually in tax breaks. Cumulatively, Microsoft&apos;s state tax has saved its shareholders $8.6 billion in costs. While the company quietly surpassed $1 trillion in all time revenue, its home state faces emergencies in education funding, homelessness, heroin addiction and escalating crime.&quot;

The first Navy drone ship is a 132-foot ACTUV (Antisubmarine warfare Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel) known as Sea Hunter, which cost around $120 million to build. The military says more can now be produced for $20 million or so each. But some are concerned that with no humans at the controls, these “robot ships” could be hacked, pwned remotely, and used by America&apos;s enemies to attack the United States.

I was captivated by the premise&amp;mdash;a young girl is visited by all sorts of peculiar anthropomorphic characters in her treehouse&amp;mdash; and by the music, which was already dated (it was by then the mid-80s) but full of fun and very catchy.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you tried to find MP3s or the band online, you wouldn&apos;t have had much luck before today. But for a couple of UK library references, it&apos;s as if it never existed. And the band (not to be confused with the &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/thebuttercupsuk/&quot;&gt;The Buttercups&lt;/a&gt;) never did another record. I still have no idea who the singer is! The writers were Ken Howard and Alan Blaikley, one of the great songwriting partnerships you&apos;ve never heard of. My best guess is that it was a quick, one-off stab at the kids&apos; music market that came to nothing.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I finally remembered it and spent ages tracking down an LP, digitizing it and uploading it all to YouTube, &lt;em&gt;no copyright intended&lt;/em&gt;. It was really something to reacquaint myself with the cast, and I&apos;m pleased to report that the creators &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; avoided stereotypes and other crutches oft-found in similar stuff from the era (Note: mafia frogs Ricky and Rocky are vaguely coded Italian; Welsh witch Myfanwy is depicted as a gypsy, and then there&apos;s MacGregor, a gruff Scottish terrier with a plaid beret.)

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s true that &lt;em&gt;Timbertops&lt;/em&gt; might be a bit too kiddie for most grown-ups. The album doesn&apos;t really have a narrative; it&apos;s just vignettes of the oddballs that visit Jo in Timbertops. The best tracks are probably &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5usRO8tkQg8&amp;list=PLByPkXPpipqK2b1F4DEInLP8d_B1UvG7D&amp;index=10&quot;&gt;Red&lt;/a&gt; (a hippie fox; the last line of the song offers an early taste of post-McGovern liberal self-doubt) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aBDtxVhhvY&quot;&gt;Sharkey&lt;/a&gt; (a promiscuous cat whose adventures could be a parody of at least half a dozen Morrissey songs.)

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, the album cover, the characters, the songsheet and the songs themselves. (Here&apos;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMDg_XcN02E&amp;list=PLByPkXPpipqK2b1F4DEInLP8d_B1UvG7D&quot;&gt;a YouTube playlist&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href=&quot;http://boingboing.net/2016/05/04/listen-timbertops-a-rare-chi.html#more-460377&quot; class=&quot;more-link&quot;&gt;(more&amp;hellip;)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<title>Walt Whitman — patriotic poet, gay iconoclast, shrewd marketing ploy, or all three?</title>

Turns out, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.collectorsweekly.com/articles/walt-whitman/&quot;&gt;Lisa Hix learned when she spoke to Ed Centeno&lt;/a&gt;, who posted the items from his personal collection, Whitman&apos;s name and bearded visage were once used to sell everything from tobacco products and booze to apple sauce. For the record, Whitman did not smoke, and as the son of an alcoholic father, he argued on behalf of Temperance causes. Presumably, Whitman ate apple sauce, but marketers never asked his permission to to sell stuff when he was alive (1819-1892), nor was Whitman ever compensated for the use of his good name.

&lt;p&gt;All this advertising attention to Whitman is curious since, in general, poets don&apos;t make good marketing tools. The Whitman name is particularly problematic. While some people are inspired by his steadfast support of the Union cause during the Civil War, imperiling his own health to work as a nurse in a Washington, D.C., Army hospital, others see him as a very early champion of gay identity, as well as a hell of an erotic writer. Being patriotic and gay are obviously not incompatible, but the latter often gives those who would make money off the former pause.


&lt;p&gt;Here&apos;s a snip:



&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the Gilded Age, new industrial technology, particularly in chromolithography and tin-stamping, caused an explosion in product branding and advertising with colorful product labels, tin boxes, and tin signs. This new era of marketing meant familiar literary characters and beloved authors could be used to drum up excitement for an unknown products.

&lt;p&gt;So when cigar maker Frank Hartmann bought the Spark Cigar Factory in Camden, New Jersey, in the late 1880s, the celebrated local bard was an obvious mascot. By 1890, his company introduced its Walt Whitman brand of cigars. But Hartmann wasn’t the only entrepreneur to have this idea: At least a few companies in the cigar manufacturing center of Binghamton, New York, started offering their own Walt Whitman cigars around the same time. The branding arrived as Whitman was facing his mortality and doubting whether Americans were truly touched by his life’s work. When Whitman disciple Horace Traubel presented the poet with an 1890 envelope advertising Walt Whitman cigars, he reported that Whitman exclaimed, “That is fame! … It is not so bad—not as bad as it might be: give the hat a little more height and it would not be such an offense.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

<title>Escaping javscript URLs and their params</title>

<description>&lt;p&gt;Did you know the &lt;code&gt;escape()&lt;/code&gt; function is depreciated. As it turns out it doesn&apos;t handle its actual role of escaping characters that well i.e. non-ASCII. In its place you should be using &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURI&quot;&gt;encodeURI&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;OR&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent&quot;&gt;encodeURIComponent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;encodeuri&quot;&gt;encodeURI()&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use encodeURI when you want a working URL e.g. something you can use with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;location.href = &apos;&apos;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; as it assumes that the input is a complete URI that might have some characters which need encoding in it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var escapedURI = encodeURI(&quot;http://example.io/file name with spaces.html&quot;)  
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you looked at the value of escapedURI it would be &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;http://www.google.com/file%20name%20with%20spaces.html  
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;encodeURIComponent() encoded the complete string which seem handy but will actually destroy your URI &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var encodeURIComponentWithSpaces = encodeURIComponent(&quot;http://example.io/file name with spaces.html&quot;)  
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out this URL&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;http%3A%2F%2Fexample.io%2Ffile%20name%20with%20spaces.html  
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;encodeURIComponent() should be used when encoding a param part of a URI. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var encodeURIComponentOnParamsOnly = &quot;http://example.io/file.html?para1=&quot; + encodeURIComponent(&quot;va1!%$&quot;);  
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would return&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;http://example.io/file.html?para1=va1!%25%24  
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
