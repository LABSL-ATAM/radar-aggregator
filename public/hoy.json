Thatâs because the big question for Apple is going to be whether or not iPhone sales have hit a wall and that the company will see a year-over-year decline in revenue, marking a significant moment for the company which has traditionally steadily grown iPhone sales to generateâ¦ <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2016/04/26/what-to-expect-for-apples-second-quarter-results/?ncid=rss\">Read More</a>"

In 1973, Stanford sociology professor Mark Granovetter published an empirical paper called The Strength of Weak Ties. If youâre wondering about the validity of a 40-year-old study on hiring for today, consider that Professor Granovetter is one of the pioneersâ¦ <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2016/04/26/weak-ties-matter/?ncid=rss\">Read More</a>"
