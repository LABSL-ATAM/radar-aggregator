Basically, all your Halloween costumes are sorted for you and your friends – and it’s only May. This could have gone badly wrong (well, and the transgender jokes about Carlos seem unnecessary and in poor taste) – but the sketch saves itself with some clever wordplay, nice gear-spotting, and spot-on musical parodies of the three styles (even down to some Wendy Carlos tritones).

Bar-goers fought back, and many more joined in street protests over the following days in an uprising widely credited as the start of large-scale gay activism in New York and around the word. Annual pride parades in hundreds of cities commemorate the rebellion.\r\n<p>\r\nThe White House declined to comment. Yet Obama has paid tribute to the site before, most notably in his second inaugural address in 2013. In what's believed to be the first reference to gay rights in an inaugural address, Obama said the principle of equality still guides the U.S. \"just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls, and Selma, and Stonewall.\"</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Tweet tip!

It survived World War II, when writers and editors were shipped off to internment camps. Before leaving, they hid the paper's Japanese type under office floorboards. But if the money-losing paper doesn't raise about $500,000 in revenue-âby more than doubling its subscribers--it could close in December, marking the end of one of the last English-Japanese dailies in the U.S., and the oldest. \"Some of the things we cover you can't get anywhere else,\" said Michael Komai, 64, the paper's publisher, whose family has run the Little Tokyo-based publication for three generations. \"Some people aren't going to know they'll miss us until we're gone.\"</blockquote>\r\n",
