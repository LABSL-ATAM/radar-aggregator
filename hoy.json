In addition, the round was padded out with smart money from a number of angels specializing in high growth education technology. The investment will help the company continue its mission to introduce the Internet of Things to kids. <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2016/05/01/sam-labs-funding/?ncid=rss\">Read More</a>",

This isn’t even an all-time low for Twitter. But the company is a long, long ways from its successful run after its initial public offering.

This isn’t the first time I’ve said it. It probably won’t be the last. During this period of froth, companies were able to raise capital at increasingly ludicrous valuations, and entrepreneurs turned fundraising into a sport.
